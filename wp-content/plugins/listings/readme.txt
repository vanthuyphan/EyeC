Manage listings from the WordPress admin panel to display on your website.

== Description ==

Listings is a **lightweight** listing plugin for managing lists from the WordPress admin panel to display on your website.

While this plugin is in open beta, we continually improve the functionality, fix bugs and introduce new features. Please stay in the loop via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TheLookandFeel/listings) to make sure you have the latest version and are up-to-date about upcoming changes.

= Listings Extensions =

We decided to keep our core listings plugin quite lean and the real potential for more specific needs comes with our extensions. Here is the current list of available extensions for Listings available for free on WordPress.org:
